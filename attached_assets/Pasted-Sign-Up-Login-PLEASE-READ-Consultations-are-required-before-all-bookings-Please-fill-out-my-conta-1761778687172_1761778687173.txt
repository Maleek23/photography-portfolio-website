PLEASE READ

Consultations are required before all bookings. Please fill out my contact form before proceeding on this page.
At the time of booking, a 50% non-refundable deposit is required to secure your appointment date and time. All payments can be made through Zelle or Venmo. The deposit payment means that that you have read through and agree with ALL of Afo's Photos policies.
The final balance payment is due at the conclusion of the photoshoot, proofs will not be sent out until the remaining balance from the shoot is paid.
An additional $20 fee will be added to all sessions where the client is beyond 15 minutes late. If the client is late and wants additional time there is a $1.75 fee for each minute over the original end time. This will only be allowed if Afo's Photos does not have another photoshoot after yours.
After 20 minutes, the photography session will be canceled and the deposit will not be refunded. In order to reschedule or to book a new shoot, a new deposit will need to be paid.
Weather-related rescheduling will be allowed if there is rain in the forecast or if the temperature is below 65 degrees.
