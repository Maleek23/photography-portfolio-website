25 marketing ideas for photographers to try in 2025
Let’s talk about the in’s and out’s of running a photography business solo. Oftentimes, you’re the jack-of-all-trades. You are the person who captures all the genuine shots, the creative mastermind, and also the one doing all the backstage work. Such as being active on social media, editing images like a pro, dealing with admin and accounting work, or coming up with creative ways to promote your brand. The list is extremely long and overwhelming. But you don’t have to do it alone!

In today’s article, we compiled some of the best marketing ideas for photographers to try this year. These tips will help your photography work get seen, will increase your brand exposure and ultimately grow your business.

1. Get a Website
In 2025, a website is not up for debate. Customers simply expect to be able to find you online. If you don’t have your own website yet, try to tackle it before venturing into any other marketing activities. Start out with a simple portfolio site, and build on top of it. Be clear on what you’re offering and kindly guide your visitors across pages, through intuitive sections and straightforward call-to-actions.

When you own a website, you control how people interact with the content, where they click, and how they perceive your brand. Social media just doesn’t offer that privilege. Ultimately, all your marketing efforts should lead to your website. Bring those visitors in, then walk them through the process to book your services. Here is a useful article on how to build your first photography website in 6 steps.

If you have a site, keep it fresh and review it every 2-3 months, to make sure all the information is still on point. Your site must reflect the business you run today, not what it looked like years ago.


2. Build a strong network locally
To this day, word-of-mouth is a super powerful marketing tool. Besides clients, your industry peers are the ones who are actually most likely to recommend you and bring you more customers. Cultivate relationships with other creatives in your area, reach out to your local photographers community, look for networking gigs that can get you more exposure. Create a profile on communities like meetup.com, as you can find various events based on locations and interests. 

Another way to get involved in your local community is by partnering with local events and non-profit organizations to cover their photography needs. Pick events and causes that are dear to your heart, take the photos, then share the gallery with the organizers so they can post them online and on their website, along with proper credits. Partnering with these events allows you to support something you believe in, meet like-minded people, and get noticed by prospective clients.

3. Plan styled shoots
Styled shoots are a great way to diversify your portfolio, meet new vendors who can send clients your way, and stir up those creative juices. Such events are a gold mine for wedding, editorial and fashion photographers, as well as lifestyle and family photographers. Got a unique location in mind or an idea you’ve always wanted to try? Connect with other folks in the area and get to work!

4. Offer photography mini sessions
Mini sessions can be a great way to get on the radar of new, prospective clients who haven’t considered your photography service before. Since mini sessions come at a smaller cost and a shorter time commitment, compared to your regular sessions, it’s easier to get more people on board. You can plan mini sessions around specific themes or holidays, such as Valentine’s Day, Easter, Halloween, and more.

Consider using mini sessions as a way to build a network of connections and leads. Because once clients get to experience your service and photography skills, they’re more likely to come back and pay for a full session, or recommend you to their friends.

5. Join industry relevant Facebook groups
You don’t have to limit yourself to a specific physical region when building connections. Go into your Facebook dashboard, click on "Groups" in the left side bar, and search for keywords like "photography", “photography equipment/gear” or "family photographers". You can also be more specific and add a location, to see what options pop up. Connect with other talented photographers worldwide, share your work, get inspiration and practical tips, ask questions and build partnerships. 

6. Create a list with recommended vendors
Are there any vendors you love working with? Stylists, florists, make-up artists, event planners, photo studios. Create a list of recommended vendors and add it to your client guide, or build a partners page on your website. Ask them to return the favor. By mutually referring clients, you support each other AND you get to work with a team that you genuinely like.

Bonus: when your partners mention you on their website, the links they include (called backlinks) point back to your site. These backlinks help your SEO and make it easier for people to find you in search results.

7. Collect client testimonials
Let’s talk about the power of client reviews. Real stories from happy existing clients are one of the most effective ways to turn future inquiries into bookings. Share client testimonials on your website. Add them to a dedicated Client Reviews page or include "Kind Words" sections on your homepage, investment, services, or experience pages. Share testimonials on social media and tag your client—they might reshare it, helping their friends discover you as well.

To streamline the process, prepare an email template that you send after delivering their gallery, and kindly ask each client for a testimonial. Ask them to share a review on your Google Business profile (see #20), your Facebook page, or any other public platform that is relevant to your brand. Alternatively, send a questionnaire to learn more about their experience. Once you’ve collected the reviews, select the most compelling parts and use them as statements and headlines across your pages.

Bonus idea: If you use Bio Links to guide social media followers to some of your most important resources and pages, add a link to your Testimonials page so anyone can read about other people’s experience with you. You can also link to your Google Business profile, making it easily accessible for past clients to share a review.

8. Invest in personal branding photos
When people are searching for photography services, they are looking to hire a REAL person they like and connect with. Putting your face out there is one step closer to building a trustworthy relationship with potential clients. Invest in getting a few professional images of yourself, to use on your website and social media.

Ask a photographer friend to take some photos of you solo, with your partner, with your kids and pets, or while you’re photographing a client. Suggest to return the favor to your friend - that way, you both get beautiful branding photos. Alternatively, you can always take some self-portraits in your studio.

9. Streamline your visual presence
Want to have a memorable brand that is easily recognized by customers? Keep a cohesive aesthetic across all your communication touchpoints. On your website, social media channels, in your email signature, while delivering galleries, on your contracts and invoices. No worries if you don’t have a professional brand identity. Choose 1-2 of your favorite fonts, a color palette that you relate with, and combine them with your branding photos. To help you out, we compiled 10 elegant font and color combinations you can use on your website and across other channels. 


10. Offer a freebie to grow your email list
Emails are the easiest way to reach your clients. You don’t depend on algorithms, and you control when and what you communicate to your audience, straight to their inbox. Grow an email list of loyal customers who genuinely care about your brand and are interested in what you have to share.

Build your list by offering a useful freebie on your website, that people can download in exchange for their email. Once they sign up, follow up with an email sequence to introduce yourself, present your work and get subscribers familiar with your services.

Here are a few freebie ideas to try out:

“The ultimate stress-free wedding checklist”
“10 tips to prepare for a boudoir photoshoot”
“20 epic elopement locations in X location”
“10 brilliant floral artists you can hire in X location”
“In-home family photoshoot checklist”.
11. Host a partner giveaway
Reach out to your partners or industry vendors (floral designers, photo studios, makeup artists, stylists, etc.) and run a giveaway with amazing prizes from both parties involved, for both of your communities. Giveaways let you tap into your partners’ community and introduce your services to them. Run it on Instagram if you’re looking to increase your following, or have people sign up to your newsletter, in order to grow your email list.

12. Create landing pages to target specific client needs
While the pages on your website provide a general overview about who you are and what you offer, a landing page allows you to cover a niched topic. Landing pages are often used for SEO and ad campaigns. Their main function is to convert viewers into clients or subscribers, through targeted keywords and one, clear call to action. Since these pages are not for the general public, they can be hidden from your main website menu.

For example, you could create a landing page about your seasonal mini sessions. On this page share more details about your process, highlight image examples, client testimonials, and include a direct link to your booking site. Another option would be a landing page about the benefits of ordering albums and prints after a session. Share the options you offer, show close-up images and videos of the final product, and how to place an order. Need more tips? Here is a guide on how to create the best landing pages for your photography website.

With Pixieset you can easily add a new page to your website, keep it hidden from the menu and have clients access it through a direct link. You can also funnel potential customers into the landing page through paid ads and posts on social media. 

13. Get on Pinterest
Whether it’s planning for a home renovation, a dinner recipe or an important life event, Pinterest is the place where people go for inspiration. Once you start pinning photo examples from your portfolio and blog, you make yourself available to thousands of users that actually want to find you. Make sure to include a link into each of your pins, to direct traffic from Pinterest to your website. Use relevant keywords when adding titles and descriptions to your pins, to increase the likelihood of them being found.

Hone in your audience based on type of interests, whether that’s clients who are looking for a photographer, location or outfit ideas for a family photoshoot, or industry peers who need inspiration and guidance. Take them to your homepage, portfolio page, or create targeted landing pages based on the topic you’re pinning about.

14. Create [more] video content
Before the introvert in you scrolls past this, listen out: the best way to get more exposure online is through video content. We hear you — getting in front of the camera can be intimidating, and it’s normal to avoid it. But you can still present the real person behind your brand without showing your face. Grab your phone and film short, easy-to-digest videos with BTS moments, posing tips, or outfit ideas, then share them on social media. You can also record the process of booking, receiving a photo gallery, and any information that will help your potential clients feel more confident to hire you.

15. Start a Podcast
Too shy to get in front of the camera? Try the audio format, it has become extremely popular in the past years. Because people are busy, they usually listen to podcasts or audiobooks while doing other things.

A podcast is also a great way to nurture partnerships with your industry peers, tap more into education, and build a loyal community around your brand. Nonetheless, a podcast does take time, and if you’re not ready to commit to a big project, yet start by getting some exposure as a guest on other podcasts in the photography industry.

16. Recycle and repurpose content
Being active on social media can be exhausting. The good news is that you don’t have to come up with new content every day. Just recycle and reuse older posts. A blogpost, video, or podcast episode can be turned into 5 Instagram posts, 20 pins, and about 3-4 reels. Present the same content again and again, only in different ways. Work in batches, create content for weeks ahead and schedule it via apps like Later, Planoly or Facebook Creator Studio.


17. Offer prints
Prints stand the test of time. By offering your couples the option to order beautiful prints and photo albums, you’re giving them a way to share their special memories with loved ones while showcasing your work. Prints aren’t just keepsakes, they’re also a great marketing tool for your brand. When clients’ friends and family see your stunning photos printed, you are likely to be the first photographer they think of for their next important life event.

18. Share a client guide
A client guide is a useful resource that you offer your customers to help them prepare for their photo session. It will help you reduce the back-and-forths in your communication since it answers the most frequently asked questions that you get from clients. You can also offer it as a freebie in exchange for an email (see #10) to grow your subscribers list with leads that can potentially become paying customers.

Compile the client guide as a .pdf file with useful information, vendor recommendations, outfit inspirations, shooting locations, event timeline, or any other insights that can help your clients feel more prepared for their session and know what to expect.

19. Offer discounts to returning clients

19. Offer discounts to returning clients
Show your returning clients how much you appreciate them by offering a discount on their next session. Not only will they feel valued, but they’ll also be more likely to recommend you to their friends and family. For an extra personal touch, get creative with the coupon code — use the client’s name, tie it to their previous experience with you, or even include the name of their pet. Returning clients are some of your best brand ambassadors, and offering discounts is a smart, cost-effective way to encourage repeat business, which is often more affordable than finding new clients.

20. Master the art of blogging 
Take a look at your recent blog posts. Are they mostly just collections of your favorite shoot photos? While that’s a great way to showcase your work, the truth is: your blog isn’t just for your visitors, it’s for Google too!

Blog posts are a great way to boost your SEO, helping Google and other search engines “read” the content on your site and improve your ranking. When people search for a photographer, your posts will appear based on the keywords they use. Include a few paragraphs of text with relevant keywords inside your blog posts, mention other vendors and link them through, optimize all your images, and name them with descriptive titles.

21. Build on your local SEO
Local SEO helps you increase the website traffic that comes from local online searches. If you photograph in a certain location, you want to be found online when someone searches for that location, ie. “Wedding Photographer in Utah”. Try Google Trends to find the right keywords for your business and location. Use them across pages on your website, in your headlines, in blogposts and in image titles. Here are more great tips on local SEO.

22. Create a Google Business profile
What is the first thing you do before visiting a new restaurant, or when booking an unknown vendor? You search them up on Google. You look at reviews. Setting up a Google Business profile will help list your business in the search results with a location, opening/closing times, website URL, photos and reviews. It will also help your SEO, since your page gets bumped up in search results. Therefore, when someone searches for your business in Google, your profile will show at the top. Once you set it up, kindly ask your clients and vendors to leave you a review on the page. 

23. Automate your processes
While this is not directly related to marketing, automating other aspects of your business gives you mental space to be more creative. You can’t be a visionary when you’re overwhelmed with constant admin work. Think what daily to-do’s you can get off your plate. It can be anything from scheduling social media posts, setting up email sequences, sending contracts or reminding clients to pay their deposit/invoice. It may take time to set up the automations initially, but your future self will thank you later. The fewer operational activities to deal with, the more time you can allocate to your creative endeavors and marketing efforts.

24. Offer impeccable customer experience
What makes a great client experience? Anticipating your customers’ needs and going above and beyond their expectations. If you do that, clients will recommend your photography services to everyone they know. Send out questionnaires to ask what preferences they have when working with you, but also to collect feedback after the session. Questionnaires help you understand what aspects could be improved for your future clients. It’s also a great way to gather testimonials that you can feature on your website.

Check out this article with 40+ question ideas to include in your Questionnaires, sorted by type of photography and stages of client communication.

25. Show kindness across all your communication channels
Go that extra mile, show that you care. Engage with your audience online - comment on their social media posts, reply to their comments under your posts. Show genuine empathy when you answer DM’s. Ask your clients to tag you whenever they post a picture you’ve taken. Thank them for that. At the end of the day, being a nice human is all that matters in business. 

So many exciting ideas to try in 2025! We’re convinced you have the skill and knowledge to tackle each of them. But, you don’t have to go all out, and most certainly — you don’t have to do it alone. Build a support system of caring people and efficient tools for your business, to leave space for rest, inspiration, friends and family.
