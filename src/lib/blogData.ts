Concert photography is one of the most challenging yet rewarding types of photography. The combination of low light, fast-moving subjects, and unpredictable lighting makes it both exciting and demanding.

## Essential Camera Settings

When shooting concerts, I typically use these settings as a starting point:
- **ISO**: 1600-6400 depending on venue lighting
- **Aperture**: f/2.8 or wider to let in maximum light
- **Shutter Speed**: 1/250s minimum to freeze motion
- **Focus Mode**: Continuous AF to track moving performers

## Understanding Stage Lighting

Stage lighting changes constantly during performances. Here's what I've learned:
- Anticipate lighting changes between songs
- Use spot metering to expose for the performer's face
- Embrace dramatic shadows and colored lights as creative elements
- Shoot in RAW format for maximum flexibility in post-processing

## Positioning and Composition

Your position in the venue matters enormously:
- The "photo pit" typically allows the first 3 songs
- Move around to capture different angles and perspectives
- Look for unique moments: guitar solos, crowd interactions, dramatic poses
- Don't forget wide shots that show the entire stage and crowd energy

## Post-Processing Tips

My editing workflow for concert photos:
1. Adjust exposure and recover highlights/shadows
2. Fine-tune white balance to preserve the mood
3. Boost clarity and texture to emphasize details
4. Reduce noise while maintaining sharpness
5. Crop and straighten for final composition

Remember, the goal is to capture the energy and emotion of the performance. Technical perfection matters less than the feeling you convey through your images.

Lighting is the foundation of portrait photography. It shapes faces, creates mood, and transforms ordinary images into extraordinary ones.

## My Go-To Lighting Setups

### 1. Rembrandt Lighting
This classic setup creates a small triangle of light on the shadowed cheek. It's dramatic yet flattering, perfect for adding depth and character to portraits.

**Setup**: Position your key light at 45 degrees to the side and slightly above the subject's face.

### 2. Split Lighting
For a bold, dramatic look, I use split lighting where exactly half the face is lit and half is in shadow.

**Setup**: Place your light source 90 degrees to the side of your subject.

### 3. Butterfly Lighting
This glamorous lighting style creates a small butterfly-shaped shadow under the nose.

**Setup**: Position the light source directly in front and above the subject's face.

## Natural Light Techniques

You don't always need expensive equipment. Natural light can be incredibly powerful:
- **Golden hour**: Shoot during sunrise/sunset for warm, flattering light
- **Window light**: Use a north-facing window as a soft, diffused light source
- **Reflectors**: Bounce natural light to fill shadows and add dimension

## Adding Creative Elements

To make portraits stand out, I often incorporate:
- Colored gels on background lights
- Backlighting for rim light effects
- Practical lights in the scene (lamps, candles, LED strips)
- Textured shadows using gobos or natural elements

## The Most Important Element

Technical knowledge is important, but remember: the connection between photographer and subject creates the best portraits. Make your subject comfortable, communicate clearly, and let their personality shine through.

Graduation marks a significant milestone, and graduation photos should capture the pride, achievement, and excitement of this moment.

## Pre-Session Planning

Success starts before the shoot:
- **Scout locations**: Find 2-3 spots on or near campus with good lighting and meaningful backdrops
- **Timing**: Schedule during golden hour (2 hours before sunset) for the best natural light
- **Outfit coordination**: Discuss cap and gown options, plus 1-2 additional outfit changes
- **Props**: Consider bringing the diploma, tassel, school banner, or personal items

## Essential Shot List

Every graduation session should include:
1. Classic cap and gown portraits
2. Candid tossing cap photos
3. Close-up shots showing details (tassel, cords, rings)
4. Environmental shots featuring campus landmarks
5. Celebratory action shots (jumping, laughing)
6. Serious, professional headshot-style images

## Location Recommendations

The best graduation photo locations include:
- Campus landmarks (distinctive buildings, entrance signs)
- Libraries or academic halls
- Beautiful outdoor spaces (gardens, courtyards)
- Urban settings near campus for modern, edgy shots

## Working with Graduates

Tips for directing your subject:
- Start with formal poses to build confidence
- Move to candid, fun shots once they're comfortable
- Give specific, actionable directions
- Show them preview images to build excitement
- Allow time for family photos if needed

## Post-Processing Workflow

My editing approach for graduation photos:
1. Maintain natural skin tones and colors
2. Enhance the school colors in the cap and gown
3. Clean up any distracting background elements
4. Create both color and black & white versions
5. Deliver images optimized for both print and digital sharing

Graduation photos should feel timeless while capturing the unique personality of each graduate. Take the time to make each session personal and meaningful.

Creative projects allow me to push boundaries and explore photography as an art form beyond commercial work. Let me take you behind the scenes of my latest conceptual series.

## The Concept

This project explores the relationship between urban environments and personal identity. I wanted to create a series that shows how cities shape us and how we, in turn, shape our environments.

**Theme**: Urban Identity
**Visual Style**: High contrast, geometric compositions, bold colors
**Duration**: 3 weeks of shooting

## Pre-Production Planning

Before picking up the camera:
1. **Mood board creation**: Collected reference images on Pinterest
2. **Location scouting**: Explored 15+ locations, selected 6 final spots
3. **Model casting**: Found models whose personal style matched the concept
4. **Styling**: Coordinated wardrobes with urban/street fashion aesthetic
5. **Equipment prep**: Packed portable lighting for on-location shoots

## Execution Challenges

Every creative project has obstacles:
- **Weather**: Rescheduled twice due to rain
- **Permits**: Secured permission for certain high-profile locations
- **Lighting**: Balanced ambient city lights with my own lighting
- **Crowds**: Shot early mornings to avoid busy areas

## Technical Approach

Camera and lighting setup:
- Shot primarily at f/2.8 for subject separation
- Used off-camera flash with gels for creative color
- Embraced practical lights (neon signs, street lamps)
- Mixed natural and artificial light sources

## Post-Processing Vision

The editing tied everything together:
- Increased contrast for dramatic, urban feel
- Selectively enhanced colors (blues, oranges)
- Maintained gritty textures in backgrounds
- Unified color grading across all images

## Lessons Learned

What I took away from this project:
- Planning is crucial but leave room for spontaneity
- The best moments often happen between posed shots
- Personal projects fuel creativity for commercial work
- Collaboration with subjects produces better results

This project reminded me why I fell in love with photography. It's not just about technical skills—it's about storytelling, vision, and artistic expression.

Booking a portrait session is exciting, but showing up prepared makes all the difference. Here's my guide to help you get the most out of your session.

## What to Wear

Your outfit sets the tone for the entire shoot:
- **Solid colors** photograph better than busy patterns or logos
- **Layering** adds visual interest — jackets, accessories, and textures work well
- **Bring 2-3 outfits** for variety (even if we don't use them all)
- **Avoid neon colors** — they can reflect onto your skin
- **Iron or steam** your clothes beforehand to avoid wrinkles in close-up shots

## Grooming Tips

Small details make a big difference on camera:
- Get haircuts or touch-ups 3-5 days before (not the day of)
- Keep nails clean and groomed if hands will be in the shot
- Moisturize the night before for healthy, glowing skin
- Guys: trim or shape facial hair the morning of

## On the Day

A few things to remember:
- **Get a good night's sleep** — it shows on camera
- **Stay hydrated** — it genuinely improves how your skin looks
- **Eat before the session** so your energy stays up
- **Arrive on time** so we don't rush through setups

## Mindset Matters

The biggest thing I tell every client: **you don't need to know how to pose.** That's my job. All you need to bring is yourself.

If you're nervous, that's completely normal. Most people loosen up within the first 5-10 minutes once the music is playing and we start shooting. I'll guide you through every pose and angle.

## What to Expect During the Session

Here's the typical flow:
1. We'll chat briefly about the vibe you're going for
2. Start with natural, relaxed poses to warm up
3. Move through outfit changes and location shifts
4. I'll show you some shots on the back of the camera to build your confidence
5. We'll wrap up with any specific shots you had in mind

## After the Session

Expect your edited gallery within 7-14 days depending on your package. I'll send a private online gallery where you can download, share, and even order prints.

The most important thing? Have fun with it. The best photos happen when you're genuinely enjoying yourself.

You've spent years studying, grinding, and pushing through. Graduation day comes and goes in a blur. Professional photos are the one thing that makes the moment last forever.

## Phone Photos vs. Professional Photos

Let's be honest — your friend can take a decent iPhone photo. But there's a reason professionals exist:
- **Lighting**: We know how to use natural and artificial light to make you look your best
- **Composition**: Every frame is intentional — no awkward cropping or cluttered backgrounds
- **Editing**: Professional color grading and retouching that iPhone filters can't replicate
- **Direction**: We'll guide you into poses that look natural and flattering

## It's About More Than Just a Photo

A graduation session is an experience. It's a chance to:
- Celebrate YOUR achievement on YOUR terms
- Express your personality beyond the cap and gown
- Create images your family will treasure for decades
- Have content for LinkedIn, social media, and your personal brand

## When to Book

Timing matters more than you think:
- **Before graduation day** is ideal — you'll have more time, better energy, and we can pick the perfect golden hour slot
- **Spring graduates**: Book in March or April to beat the rush
- **Fall graduates**: September through early November gives us the best light and weather
- Graduation day itself is hectic — you'll be rushing between ceremonies, family, and friends

## What's Included

My graduation packages include:
- 1-2 hour session with multiple outfit changes
- On-campus and off-campus locations
- Professional editing and color grading
- Digital gallery with download access
- Quick turnaround (7-14 business days)

## Real Talk

I've photographed hundreds of graduates, and the one thing they all say afterward is: "I'm so glad I did this." Nobody regrets investing in professional photos of one of the biggest milestones of their life.

Your degree took years of work. Your photos should reflect that same level of quality.

Houston has no shortage of photographers. A quick Google search returns thousands of results. So how do you pick the right one? Here's what actually matters.

## 1. Look at Their Portfolio — Not Just Their Best 5 Photos

Every photographer can curate 5 amazing shots. What you want to see is consistency:
- Do their images have a recognizable style?
- Is the quality consistent across different sessions?
- Do the subjects look natural and comfortable?
- Does their editing style match what you're looking for?

## 2. Style Matters More Than Equipment

A photographer with a $500 camera and great vision will outshoot someone with a $5,000 setup and no creativity. Focus on:
- **Moody vs. bright**: Do you want dramatic, cinematic tones or light and airy vibes?
- **Posed vs. candid**: Some photographers excel at directed shoots, others at documentary-style
- **Color grading**: Their editing style should match the look you want

## 3. Check Reviews and Communication

Red flags to watch for:
- Slow or vague responses to your initial inquiry
- No clear pricing or packages listed
- Pushy upselling before you've even booked
- No contract or terms of service

Green flags:
- Quick, friendly communication
- Transparent pricing
- A clear process from booking to delivery
- Genuine interest in your vision

## 4. Understand What You're Paying For

Photography pricing varies wildly in Houston. Here's what affects cost:
- **Experience level**: Established photographers charge more because their work is proven
- **Session length**: Longer sessions = more outfit changes, locations, and final images
- **Editing quality**: Professional retouching takes hours per image
- **Deliverables**: Number of edited photos, turnaround time, print options

## 5. Meet or Video Call Before Booking

Chemistry matters. You'll be spending 1-2 hours together, and the best photos come when you're comfortable with your photographer. A quick call helps you gauge:
- Do they listen to your ideas?
- Are they flexible or rigid?
- Do they seem genuinely excited about your session?

## 6. Location Knowledge

A Houston-based photographer who knows the city is invaluable:
- Best golden hour spots (Hermann Park, Buffalo Bayou, UH campus)
- Hidden gems most people don't know about
- How to work with Houston's unpredictable weather
- Permit requirements for certain locations

## The Bottom Line

The "best" photographer isn't the most expensive one or the one with the most followers. It's the one whose style matches your vision, whose communication makes you feel valued, and whose work consistently delivers quality. Trust your gut — if their portfolio makes you excited, that's your answer.
