Concert photography is one of the most challenging yet rewarding types of photography. The combination of low light, fast-moving subjects, and unpredictable lighting makes it both exciting and demanding.

## Essential Camera Settings

When shooting concerts, I typically use these settings as a starting point:
- **ISO**: 1600-6400 depending on venue lighting
- **Aperture**: f/2.8 or wider to let in maximum light
- **Shutter Speed**: 1/250s minimum to freeze motion
- **Focus Mode**: Continuous AF to track moving performers

## Understanding Stage Lighting

Stage lighting changes constantly during performances. Here's what I've learned:
- Anticipate lighting changes between songs
- Use spot metering to expose for the performer's face
- Embrace dramatic shadows and colored lights as creative elements
- Shoot in RAW format for maximum flexibility in post-processing

## Positioning and Composition

Your position in the venue matters enormously:
- The "photo pit" typically allows the first 3 songs
- Move around to capture different angles and perspectives
- Look for unique moments: guitar solos, crowd interactions, dramatic poses
- Don't forget wide shots that show the entire stage and crowd energy

## Post-Processing Tips

My editing workflow for concert photos:
1. Adjust exposure and recover highlights/shadows
2. Fine-tune white balance to preserve the mood
3. Boost clarity and texture to emphasize details
4. Reduce noise while maintaining sharpness
5. Crop and straighten for final composition

Remember, the goal is to capture the energy and emotion of the performance. Technical perfection matters less than the feeling you convey through your images.

Lighting is the foundation of portrait photography. It shapes faces, creates mood, and transforms ordinary images into extraordinary ones.

## My Go-To Lighting Setups

### 1. Rembrandt Lighting
This classic setup creates a small triangle of light on the shadowed cheek. It's dramatic yet flattering, perfect for adding depth and character to portraits.

**Setup**: Position your key light at 45 degrees to the side and slightly above the subject's face.

### 2. Split Lighting
For a bold, dramatic look, I use split lighting where exactly half the face is lit and half is in shadow.

**Setup**: Place your light source 90 degrees to the side of your subject.

### 3. Butterfly Lighting
This glamorous lighting style creates a small butterfly-shaped shadow under the nose.

**Setup**: Position the light source directly in front and above the subject's face.

## Natural Light Techniques

You don't always need expensive equipment. Natural light can be incredibly powerful:
- **Golden hour**: Shoot during sunrise/sunset for warm, flattering light
- **Window light**: Use a north-facing window as a soft, diffused light source
- **Reflectors**: Bounce natural light to fill shadows and add dimension

## Adding Creative Elements

To make portraits stand out, I often incorporate:
- Colored gels on background lights
- Backlighting for rim light effects
- Practical lights in the scene (lamps, candles, LED strips)
- Textured shadows using gobos or natural elements

## The Most Important Element

Technical knowledge is important, but remember: the connection between photographer and subject creates the best portraits. Make your subject comfortable, communicate clearly, and let their personality shine through.

Graduation marks a significant milestone, and graduation photos should capture the pride, achievement, and excitement of this moment.

## Pre-Session Planning

Success starts before the shoot:
- **Scout locations**: Find 2-3 spots on or near campus with good lighting and meaningful backdrops
- **Timing**: Schedule during golden hour (2 hours before sunset) for the best natural light
- **Outfit coordination**: Discuss cap and gown options, plus 1-2 additional outfit changes
- **Props**: Consider bringing the diploma, tassel, school banner, or personal items

## Essential Shot List

Every graduation session should include:
1. Classic cap and gown portraits
2. Candid tossing cap photos
3. Close-up shots showing details (tassel, cords, rings)
4. Environmental shots featuring campus landmarks
5. Celebratory action shots (jumping, laughing)
6. Serious, professional headshot-style images

## Location Recommendations

The best graduation photo locations include:
- Campus landmarks (distinctive buildings, entrance signs)
- Libraries or academic halls
- Beautiful outdoor spaces (gardens, courtyards)
- Urban settings near campus for modern, edgy shots

## Working with Graduates

Tips for directing your subject:
- Start with formal poses to build confidence
- Move to candid, fun shots once they're comfortable
- Give specific, actionable directions
- Show them preview images to build excitement
- Allow time for family photos if needed

## Post-Processing Workflow

My editing approach for graduation photos:
1. Maintain natural skin tones and colors
2. Enhance the school colors in the cap and gown
3. Clean up any distracting background elements
4. Create both color and black & white versions
5. Deliver images optimized for both print and digital sharing

Graduation photos should feel timeless while capturing the unique personality of each graduate. Take the time to make each session personal and meaningful.

Creative projects allow me to push boundaries and explore photography as an art form beyond commercial work. Let me take you behind the scenes of my latest conceptual series.

## The Concept

This project explores the relationship between urban environments and personal identity. I wanted to create a series that shows how cities shape us and how we, in turn, shape our environments.

**Theme**: Urban Identity
**Visual Style**: High contrast, geometric compositions, bold colors
**Duration**: 3 weeks of shooting

## Pre-Production Planning

Before picking up the camera:
1. **Mood board creation**: Collected reference images on Pinterest
2. **Location scouting**: Explored 15+ locations, selected 6 final spots
3. **Model casting**: Found models whose personal style matched the concept
4. **Styling**: Coordinated wardrobes with urban/street fashion aesthetic
5. **Equipment prep**: Packed portable lighting for on-location shoots

## Execution Challenges

Every creative project has obstacles:
- **Weather**: Rescheduled twice due to rain
- **Permits**: Secured permission for certain high-profile locations
- **Lighting**: Balanced ambient city lights with my own lighting
- **Crowds**: Shot early mornings to avoid busy areas

## Technical Approach

Camera and lighting setup:
- Shot primarily at f/2.8 for subject separation
- Used off-camera flash with gels for creative color
- Embraced practical lights (neon signs, street lamps)
- Mixed natural and artificial light sources

## Post-Processing Vision

The editing tied everything together:
- Increased contrast for dramatic, urban feel
- Selectively enhanced colors (blues, oranges)
- Maintained gritty textures in backgrounds
- Unified color grading across all images

## Lessons Learned

What I took away from this project:
- Planning is crucial but leave room for spontaneity
- The best moments often happen between posed shots
- Personal projects fuel creativity for commercial work
- Collaboration with subjects produces better results

This project reminded me why I fell in love with photography. It's not just about technical skills—it's about storytelling, vision, and artistic expression.
